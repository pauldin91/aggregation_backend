## Motivation

In many real-world scenarios, backend systems must **aggregate** and **normalize** data from multiple external APIs or services.  
This project aims to demonstrate a clean, maintainable approach using DDD principles to coordinate and unify disparate sources into a coherent domain model.

## Architecture

- Based on DDD (Domain-Driven Design) to separate concerns (domain, application, infrastructure)  
- Each external data source has its own adapter/integration layer  
- A coordination or “aggregator” component merges or reconciles data  
- Emphasis on clean code, testability, and clear boundaries  

## Features

- Integration with three external data sources  
- Data transformation, normalization, and merging logic  
- Clear separation of domain logic and infrastructure concerns  
- Easily extensible to add more sources or change existing ones  
- Basics of error handling and fallback strategies  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
